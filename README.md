Zscaler Cloud Connector Azure Terraform Modules
===========================================================================================================

# **README for Azure Terraform**

This README serves as a quick start guide to deploy Zscaler Cloud Connector resources in Microsoft Azure using Terraform. To learn more about the resources created when deploying Cloud Connector with Terraform, see [Deployment Templates for Zscaler Cloud Connector](https://help.zscaler.com/cloud-branch-connector/deployment-templates-zscaler-cloud-connector).

## **Azure Deployment Scripts for Terraform**

Use this repository to create the deployment resources required to deploy and operate Cloud Connector in a new or existing resource group and virtual network. The [examples directory](https://github.com/zscaler/terraform-azurerm-cloud-connector-modules/tree/main/examples) contains complete automation scripts for both greenfield/POV and brownfield/production use.

## **Prerequisites**

Our Deployment scripts are leveraging Terraform v1.1.9 which includes full binary and provider support for macOS M1 chips, but any Terraform version 0.13.7 should be generally supported.

- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm >= 4.9.0, < 5.0.0
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v3.3.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local v2.2.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v3.1.x
- provider registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls v3.4.x

### **Azure Requirements**

1. Azure Subscription Id [link to Azure subscriptions](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade)
2. Have/Create a Service Principal. See: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)). Then Collect:
    - Application (client) ID
    - Directory (tenant) ID
    - Client Secret Value
3. Azure Region (e.g. westus2) where Cloud Connector resources are to be deployed
4. User-created Azure Managed Identity. Role Assignment: Network Contributor (If using a Custom Role, the minimum requirement is: Microsoft. Network/networkInterfaces/read) Scope: Subscription or Resource Group (where Cloud Connector VMs will be deployed)
5. Azure Vault URL with Zscaler Cloud Connector Credentials (E.g. [https://zscaler-cc-demo.vault.azure.net](https://zscaler-cc-demo.vault.azure.net/)) Add an access policy to the above Key Vault as below
    - Secret Permissions: Get, List
    - Select Principal: The Managed Identity created in the above step
6. Accept the Cloud Connector VM image terms for the Subscription(s) where Cloud Connector is to be deployed. This can be done via the Azure Portal, Cloud Shell or az cli / powershell with a valid admin user/service principal in the correct subscription where Cloud Connector is being deployed Run Command: `az vm image terms accept --urn zscaler1579058425289:zia_cloud_connector:zs_ser_gen1_cc_01:latest`

### Terraform client requirements
7. If executing Terraform via the "zsec" wrapper bash script, it is advised that you run from a MacOS or Linux workstation. Minimum installed application requirements to successfully from the script are:
    - bash | curl | unzip | rm | cp | find | grep | sed | dig | jq (for vmss manual_sync script)

<p>These can all be installed via your distribution app installer. ie: sudo apt install bash curl unzip</p>

### **Zscaler requirements**

8. A valid Zscaler Cloud Connector provisioning URL generated. This is done via the Cloud Connector portal (E.g. connector..net/login)
9. Zscaler Cloud Connector Credentials (api key, username, password) are stored in Azure Key Vault from step 5.

### *Host Disk Encryption*
To enable host encryption. You **must** subscribe to the feature on your azure account. Official Microsoft Documentation on how to enable this feature can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-portal?tabs=azure-cli#prerequisites)


## **Greenfield Deployments** 

Use this if you are building an entire cluster from the ground up. These templates include a bastion host and test workloads and are designed for greenfield/POV testing. See [Modules](modules/) for the Terraform configurations for greenfield deployment.

### **Starter Deployment Template**

Use the [**Starter Deployment Template**](examples/base_1cc) to deploy your Cloud Connector in a new resource group and virtual network.

### **Starter Deployment Template with ZPA**

Use the [**Starter Deployment Template with ZPA**](examples/base_1cc_zpa) to deploy your Cloud Connector in a new resource group and virtual network with Azure Private DNS Resolver capability.

### **Starter Deployment Template with Load Balancer**

Use the [**Starter Deployment Template with Load Balancer**](examples/base_cc_lb) to deploy your Cloud Connector in a new resource group and virtual network and to load balance traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors. Zscaler's recommended deployment method is Azure Standard Load Balancer. Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors and achieves high availability.

### **Starter Deployment Template with Load Balancer and ZPA**

Use the [**Starter Deployment Template with Load Balancer and ZPA**](examples/base_cc_lb_zpa) to deploy your Cloud Connector in a new resource group and virtual network and to load balance traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors with Azure Private DNS Resolver capability. Zscaler's recommended deployment method is Azure Standard Load Balancer. Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors and achieves high availability.

### **Starter Deployment Template with Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**

Use the [**Starter Deployment Template with VMSS**](examples/base_cc_vmss) to deploy your Cloud Connectors in a new resource group and virtual network to load balance traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors. Zscaler's recommended deployment method is Azure Standard Load Balancer. Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors and achieves high availability. For added resiliency and elasticity, Cloud Connectors are deployed in Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) with accompanying Zscaler Function App packaged zip file.

### **Starter Deployment Template with Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) and ZPA**

Zscaler's recommended deployment method is Azure Standard Load Balancer. Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors and achieves high availability. For added resiliency and elasticity, Cloud Connectors are deployed in Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) with accompanying Zscaler Function App packaged zip file.


## **Brownfield Deployment**

Brownfield deployment templates are most applicable for production deployments and have more customization options than a "base" deployment. They also do not include a bastion or workload hosts deployed. See [Modules](modules/) for the Terraform configurations for brownfield deployment.

### **Custom Deployment Template with Azure Load Balancer**

Use the [**Custom Deployment template with Azure Load Balancer**](examples/cc_lb) to deploy your Cloud Connector in a new or existing VNet and load balance traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors. Zscaler's recommended deployment method is Azure Load Balancer. Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple Cloud Connectors and achieves high availability. Optional Azure Private DNS Resolver resource creation per variable zpa_enabled.
